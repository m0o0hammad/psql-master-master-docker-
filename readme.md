Setup is done on two separate nodes on the docker bed.
It should be noted that for more reliability of the system on the docker swarm bed or startup kube should not be done.
All you have to do is run Docker Compass on each of the nodes separately.
Changes are also made to change the database and repmgr configuration from within the config directory.
